# Smart Agro System Using Wireless Networks

## Overview

The **Smart Agro System** is a real-time farm management solution that leverages **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)** for monitoring and managing various environmental and agricultural factors. The system allows farmers to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and other critical parameters remotely through an integrated platform. The system is designed to provide insights that can help optimize farming operations, leading to higher crop yield and efficient resource management.
 
## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors.
- **Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)**: Uses a network of wireless sensors deployed across the farm to collect data.
- **Dynamic Frontend**: Built using **PHP** and **JavaScript** to provide a user-friendly interface for farm management.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implements secure login with encrypted data transmission.
- **Database Management**: Uses **MySQL** for storing farm data, user information, and system logs.
- **Scalability**: Optimized to handle multiple farm profiles and expand as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP, MySQL
- **Wireless Sensor Networks**: Data collection using sensor networks (e.g., soil moisture, temperature sensors)
- **Security**: Encrypted data transmission, secure user authentication
- **Other Technologies**: WSN protocols and communication systems
